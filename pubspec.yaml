# # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# # assets:
# #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
# #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
# #
# # For details regarding assets in packages, see
# # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

# # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
# # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
# # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# # example:
# # fonts:
# #   - family: Schyler
# #     fonts:
# #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
# #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
# #         style: italic
# #   - family: Trajan Pro
